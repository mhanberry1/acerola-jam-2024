## Theme: Aberration

noun

1. A deviation from what is considered proper or normal.
2. A departure from what is typical.
3. A disorder or abnormal alteration in one's mental state.

## Ideas

### How to incorporate the theme

- unexpected control scheme
- main character has a psychological disorder
- distorted sense of reality/environment
- temporal aberration
	- events occur out-of-order
	- things occur before you do them.
	- you are a time traveller and have to do things in a certain order to avoid a paradox/temporal aberration

### Type of games I want to make

- metroidvania
- art experience
- ascii art game, played in the cli

### Detailed Concepts

- a metroidvania game where you create temporal aberrations
	- you get time-related powerups
		- rewind time
		- slow time
		- stop time
	- every time you rewind, you duplicate yourself
	- you can use your copies to get across gaps, up tall ledges, and rush an enemy
